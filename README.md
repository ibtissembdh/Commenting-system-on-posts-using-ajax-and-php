###BLOG using OOP and based on MVC, for design I used Bootstarp

  # a small blog based on a simple Post and comments
  
  the structure of this blog is as follows:

      * I can have the list of posts by just displaying the number of comments in front of each
      post.
      * by clicking on a post I must reach the detail of the post and all the comments
      associated with the post
      * in the post page I can make a new comment.
      * user authentication is not used.
